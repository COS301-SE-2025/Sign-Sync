## Overview

Sign Sync is an innovative AI-powered communication bridge that enables seamless two-way translation between spoken language and sign language. Using advanced speech recognition, motion capture, and AI animation technologies, we're breaking down communication barriers in real-time.

### Core Functionality

- **Speech to Sign Language**: Translates spoken words into real-time, animated sign language gestures
- **Sign to Speech/Text**: Captures sign language movements and converts them into spoken words or text
- **Web Application**: Provides an intuitive, accessible platform for instant communication

## Target Audience

**Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing Community** – Enables effortless communication without needing an interpreter

**Hearing Individuals** – Helps those unfamiliar with sign language engage in inclusive conversations

**Educational & Workplace Settings** – Supports accessibility in schools, offices, and public services

**Developers & Tech Enthusiasts** – Cutting-edge project exploring AI, real-time animation, and human-computer interaction

## Why It Matters

Sign Sync isn't just a tool—it's a barrier-breaking solution that promotes inclusivity, independence, and seamless communication. By blending advanced technology with real-world impact, we're empowering users while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI systems.

### Git Branching Strategy

**Main Branches**
- `main` - Stable production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for ongoing work

**Supporting Branches**
- Feature branches: `feature/frontend/feature-name`, `feature/backend/feature-name`
- Release branches: `release/v1.0`, `release/v1.1`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/emergency-fix`

### Development Workflow
- Code reviews are mandatory before merging to main
- Semantic versioning for consistent release numbering
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Regular branch synchronization with main
